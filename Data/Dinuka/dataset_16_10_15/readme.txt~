for small noise data

accelerometer standard deviation = 0.1

gyroscope standard deviation = 0.01

for large noise data

accelerometer standard deviation = 0.2

gyroscope standard deviation = 0.03



for all IMU data biases are 0

ground truth position, velocity and orientation are with respect to world coordinate frame which coincides with the IMU coordinate frame at t=0. For ground truth Euler angles the 'ZYX' convention was used.
